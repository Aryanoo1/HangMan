## Hangman Game in Java

This is a simple implementation of the Hangman game in Java. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list and allows the player to guess letters until they either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.

To play the game, compile and run the `HangmanGame.java` file in your Java environment.

```bash
javac HangmanGame.java
java HangmanGame
